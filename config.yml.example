# Ticket Category Settings
# ================================
# Define different categories of tickets here.
# Each category should have a unique identifier.
# The Discord limit is 25, but it's not advisable to use that many types, as each type consumes 2 categories, and Discord's maximum is 50. Using too many types could exhaust your category options for regular Discord channels...
